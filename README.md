# 📋 Api-Specs

A curated catalog of API specifications in multiple formats — ready to grab for demos, testing, and development.

## 🤔 What Is This?

Ever need a realistic API spec *right now*? Same. This repo is a living collection of enterprise-grade API specifications in various formats. Some are hand-crafted, others are generated with GitHub Copilot. All of them are designed to look and feel like real-world APIs.

## 📑 Spec Formats

| Format | Style | Location | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| **OpenAPI 3.0** | REST | `rest/openapi/` | Modern REST API design, code generation, API gateways |
| **RAML 1.0** | REST | `rest/raml/` | MuleSoft/Anypoint-based REST APIs, design-first workflows |
| **WADL** | REST (XML) | `rest/wadl/` | Legacy REST service descriptions |
| **WSDL 1.1** | SOAP | `soap/` | Enterprise SOAP services, WCF, Java WS |

## 📛 Naming Convention

All spec files follow:

```
<api-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.<ext>
```

For example: `banking-2026-04-18.json`, `hr-2026-04-18.wsdl`, `procurement-2026-04-18.wadl`, `logistics-2026-04-18.raml`

## 🤖 Generating Specs with Copilot

This repo is set up with Copilot agents and prompts to make generating new specs easy:

- **Agent** — `spec-generator` knows the repo conventions and can produce specs in any supported format
- **Prompts** — use the reusable prompts in `.github/prompts/` to quickly generate OpenAPI, WSDL, WADL, or RAML specs

Just tell Copilot what domain you want (e.g. *"Generate an OpenAPI spec for a patient scheduling API"*) and it'll handle the rest.

## ✅ CI Pipeline

Every change goes through automated validation:

| Trigger | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| **Pull Request** | 🔍 Lints all specs — OpenAPI via [Spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral), RAML via [raml-cop](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-cop), WADL/WSDL via `xmllint` |
| **Merge to `main`** | 🔍 Lint + 📦 Package & publish a GitHub Release |

## 🚀 Using the Specs

**Grab individual files** directly from the repo, or **download a release** from the [Releases](../../releases) page to get everything packaged up.

```bash
# Clone the whole catalog
git clone https://github.com/christopherhouse/Api-Specs.git

# Or grab a single spec
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christopherhouse/Api-Specs/main/rest/openapi/banking-2026-04-18.json
```

## 🧰 Adding a New Spec

1. Pick the right directory based on format (`rest/openapi/`, `rest/raml/`, `rest/wadl/`, or `soap/`)
2. Name your file following the `<api-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.<ext>` convention
3. Open a PR — CI will lint your spec automatically
4. Merge and a new release gets cut 🎉

Or just ask the Copilot agent to generate one for you!
